   ...

Feel free to explore each project folder to learn more about its details and dive into the source code.

## Learning Journey

My journey as a developer has been a continuous learning experience. With each project, I have encountered new challenges, found creative solutions, and deepened my understanding of JavaScript. Some of the key insights and skills I gained throughout this journey include:

- **DOM Manipulation**: Understanding how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the content and structure of web pages.

- **Event Handling**: Learning to handle user interactions and respond to events such as clicks, keypresses, and form submissions.
